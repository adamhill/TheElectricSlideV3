I need to add in the Picket N-16 Electronic slide rule. Move over the .swift files in #file:pickett-N16-LogLog-Electronics to the correct places in SlideRuleCoreV3 and TheElectricSlide project

All the files you need to understand this particular slide rule are in the folder #file:pickett-N16-LogLog-Electronics 

The scales need to be integrated into all the Factory , like all the other scales, if there are naming collisions please feel free to append "pickett" to the function, class or other names

The #file:SlideRuleLibrary.swift  definition is:
(SH1, SH2,TH, DF [ CF, L,  S Cos,  ST, T T, CI, C ] D, LL3, LL2, LL1, Ln : Θ , db,  D or Q, XL , Zs or Xc [ C or L, F, λ, ω, T, TR' or X'c, Cr ] Lr, db, CosΘ

NOTE: the "or" syntax is not part of the syntax for the definitionstring, its just the two names for the ScaleName, please initially use both separated by a "/" (slash)

Pull out all the textual and historical info for the ScaleRuleDefinitionModel from the #file:README.md #file:Pickett_N16ES_Implementation_Guide.md 

Use the #file:postscript-engine-for-sliderules.ps #file:postscript-rule-engine-explainer.md  #file:manthematical-foundations-of-the-slide-rule.md 
to supplement your understanding.

CRITICAL: If you have any questions please ask, use the command line or #xcodebuildmcp to compile to find syntax errrors and run unit tests

questions
Further Considerations
Definition string syntax: Should we use scaleNameOverrides for dual names (D/Q, Zs/Xc, C/L) instead of "/" syntax in definition string? Recommend testing parser first, falling back to overrides if unsupported.

Greek letter Unicode support: Parser may need updates to handle Θ, λ, ω, τ characters. Should we prioritize ASCII equivalents ("Theta", "Lambda") or add Unicode support? Recommend supporting both in switch cases.

Four-decade scale tick density: Lr/Cr scales span 12 logarithmic cycles—may render too densely on iPhone screens. Should we create device-specific subsection variants using #if os(iOS)? Recommend testing default rendering first.
Answers to questions
Start implementation

Answers to Further Considerations:
1. Just use a string for the ScaleName, DONT CHANGE THE PARSER, the factory method supports multiple names for scales too. Add cases for that.
2. Once again DONT CHANGE THE PARSER, scaleName is just a String, use that for the Unicode symbol display, use symbol names or short ASCII string when challenged
3. Yes create a device specific subsection for iphone, implement a default density first and I can manually test, we have density problems in other places too.

Dont be afraid to ask questions along the way if you need too.
